# car-sales-prediction
This was my first machine learning project that helped me a fundamental understanding of neural networks, regression, neuron models, and network training. This project gave me a brief understanding on how to train and model and how it works.

We are given synthetic data on over 500 samples of car customers and their information. Our goal is to create a training model that uses this data to predict which car they cannot afford or will not buy. This will help our services by creating the most optimal deals for both parties.
