regression
- regression works by predicting value of one variable based
on another variable x

- goal is to obtain a relationship between the annual salary and car purchasing amount (using y = mx+b)
- once the coefficient 'm' and 'b' are obtained, we are able to build the regression model
- will later use this model to predict car purchase amount based on annual salary

artificial neural networks
- similar to the brain, there are 100 million of neurons communicating with each other and help us see, think
and hear
- in artificial networks, we are trying to create something similar (neural networks)
 

 cat           input>>    loop until cat (corrected output) (brain  (deviated outputs>>  error>>)
(correct label: cat)

single neuron model
-neuron collects signals from input (dendrites) and proccess information in the nuclues than outputs in the axon
-a bunch of inputs x1, x2, x3 multipled by w1, w2, w2. bias signal that shifts the function up and down. then apply a generative
function f to create a trained model
y = f(x1w1 + x2w2 + x3w3 + b)
-if the output is positive, the output is 1, if it's negative, the output is 0


network training
- backpropogation is a method used ot train artical network neurons by calculating gradient needed to update network weights
- adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function

- Phase one: 1.foward propogation 2. calculate error
~ propogate foward through the network to generate output value
~ propogate output activations back through the network using training pattern target inorder to generate delta
(difference between targeted and actual ouput values)

- Phase two: 3. back propogation 4.weight update
~ calculate weight gradientratio of weight gradients is subtract from weight
~ ratio influences the speed and quality of learning called the learning rate.
~ the greater the ratio the faster the neuron train. lower ratio, more accurate the training is

two neuron model: matrix representation
- combine two singular neuron model
- f(W * P + b)

Coding

- 'X'to represent inputs and 'y' for output
- remove unecessary x-values or columns
- we need to scale the data before training the model
